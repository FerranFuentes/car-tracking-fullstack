#+title: Instructions

** Running the dev enviromment
Run docker and open a shell inside the backend container

#+begin_src sh
  docker-compose run --service-ports backend
#+end_src

** Testing a local deploy

To run everything remove the comment: =# command: ...= on =docker-compose.yml=, then:

#+begin_src sh
  docker-compose up -d
#+end_src

This will leave the service exposed at port 8080 of the container and also
on the localhost.
